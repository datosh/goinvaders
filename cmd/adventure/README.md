# Adventure

## Overview



## Mechanics

### Enemies

#### Rare

Glow - itself is strong, should be focus target.
Name should reflect their additional properties.

#### Elite

Aura - buffs nearby enemies, should focus minions first.
Name should reflect their aura properties.

### Exploration

Best items and discoveries should be off the main path.

Teach player early that exploration is optional, but provides huge upsides.

#### Light

No light, no visibility.
This is something a character has to figure out before entering a dungeon.
Ring with light, or a torch, or a lamp, or a spell, ...

### Auto Loot Feature

Consider characters attributes when picking up items.
In multi-character party do a priority consideration of:
+ attributes
+ distance to item
+ inventory space

### Inventory

Space-based vs. weight-based.

Space-based inventory, where backpacks and pouches are different containers with
requirements such as strength, or a mage pouch that requires intelligence.

Interesting item sizes, e.g., 1x6 staff, 3x3 shield, ... could reflect the
characteristics of the specific containers: backpacks, pouches, etc.
